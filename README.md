Audio recordings were taken from 7 different locations in a pristine rain forest in Dari√©n, Panama during the rainy and the dry season.
Furthermore, acoustic indices about several characteristics of these recordings were created in order to eventually visualize the audio.

The code (aptscript) is the analysis of the indices, where average values for different times during the day, seasons and locations were calculated. 
((it was my first project ever in R, which is very obvious))
